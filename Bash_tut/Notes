# notes for  bash scripting 

--echo prints either to the screen or to a file name
---- i.e ~$ echo Hello world # prints to the screen
          while echo "hello world" >> hello.sh prints to the file
          and chomd u+x --makes the file executable meaning you can run the file or script 
          --using ./filename.sh
---in a shell script we always use the shabang command which is 
       !#/bin/bash --making it possible to run the file without psecifying that its a shell script
       ---i.e a file hello.sh will look like
                  - !#/bin/bash
                   echo "Hello, Wolrd!"
                   and to run it we will use ./hello.sh command after making it executable

--pwd prints the current home directory

--variables in bash are denoted by --- $variable_1, $variable2, .....
     -- and ways to use such var are
                                i.e vi users_name.sh
                                    --- !#/bin/bash
